This is a quick and dirty .net 4 print server for Windows. I had some label printers attached to Windows PCs running some automation and wanted a quick and easy way to send print jobs to them from the Linux system hosting the whole process.

This is the end result.

It's not secure. It will gladly accept print jobs from anybody that connects to port 9100 and sends one. This works just like an old JetDirect card. You have been warned.

Requires .net 4.7.2, should run all the way back to Windows 7 and up to 11.
